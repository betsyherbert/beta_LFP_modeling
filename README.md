Code for FORCE-inspired RNN trainng for the modeling of Î²-LFP oscillations.

**force_architectures**

Basic network training using FORCE procedure introduced in Sussillo & Abbott, 2009 (single readout on a periodic function), then extending procedure to train: 
- single internal current on periodic function 
- several internal currents on several functions  
- all internal currents on a set of functions 

**positive_sigmoid_single**

Training on a single trial of LFP data in network with positive sigmoid nonlinearity.

**positive_sigmoid_multiple**

Training on multiple trials of LFP data in network with positive sigmoid nonlinearity.

**duplicates_single**

Training using duplicate method on single trial.

**duplicates_multiple**

Training using duplicate method on multipe trials.
